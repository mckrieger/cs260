<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>The following are descriptions of the major projects I've worked on recently for CS</p>
<hr>
<h2>Code Names</h2>
<p>A mobile of the hit party game. With this application, you can play your favorite
detective word game with friends and family around the world. It's also great for
local play so that you don't have to set up a board and crane your necks to see it.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Ticket To Ride</h2>
<p>A colaborative effort to create Lord of the Trains, also known as
Ticket to Ride: Middle Earth. This is an Android mobile app that can be played
with multiple players online.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Super Asteroids</h2>
<p>Single player mobile game for an Android phone or tablet. Much like the
hit arcade game Asteroids, but with some fun suprises.</p>
